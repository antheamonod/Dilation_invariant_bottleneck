# Dilation_invariant_bottleneck: Computing the Dilation-Invariant Bottleneck Dissimilarity and Distance for Persistent Homology

This repository provides code to implement the dilation-invariant bottleneck dissimilarity and distance for persistent homology, as well as run the numerical experiments in [Vlontzos et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01672), which studies database representations via manifold embeddings in the context of information retrieval (IR).  Appropriately representing elements in a dtabase so that queries may be accurately matched is a central task in information retrieval; recently this has been achieved by embedding the graphical structure of a database into a manifold in a hierarchy-preserving manner using a variety of metrics.  Persistent homology is a tool commonly used in topological data analysis that is abl to regorously characterize a database in terms of both its hierarchy and connectivity structure; the output of persistent homology is a persistence diagram.

Persistent homology is heavily dependent on the choice of metric endowed on the point cloud being studied: it fails to recognize when two persistence diagrams are computed from the same input data but are measured by two different metrics.  To this end, we introduce the dilation-invariant bottleneck dissimilarity and distance as comparative measures, which mitigates this effect of metric distortion on persistence diagrams.  These dilation-invariant bottleneck comparative measures erase the effect of scaling between metrics and instead focuses on the topological structure of the input point cloud.
